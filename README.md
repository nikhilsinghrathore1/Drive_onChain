# DrAn - Decentralized Ride-Sharing Application

**DrAn** is a blockchain-based ride-sharing platform, similar to Uber but leveraging decentralized technologies for transparency, security, and trust. Built using **TypeScript**, it features a clean separation of concerns with **backend (be)** and **frontend (fe)** directories.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: All ride data, payments, and user interactions are secured and recorded on-chain.
- **Decentralized Payments**: Payments are handled transparently through smart contracts.
- **Secure & Trustless**: No centralized entity controls the platform.
- **Frontend and Backend**: Fully implemented using TypeScript for scalability and maintainability.
